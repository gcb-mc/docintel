## Features
-- **Multi-Environment Support**: Seamless integration with Azure AI Foundry and Document Intelligence Studio for classification workflows.
-- **Custom Classification Models**: Train and deploy models to classify documents by type using labeled folders and Azure Blob Storage.
-- **No-Code Studio Interface**: Use Document Intelligence Studio to build, train, and test classifiers without writing code.
-- **Content Understanding Integration**: Chain classification output into Azure AI Foundry‚Äôs Content Understanding for schema-based extraction and downstream processing.
-- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports large-scale document ingestion and classification with confidence scoring and schema validation.
-- **Extensible Framework**:
  - üîÑ Adaptable for various document types and formats
  - üéØ Supports custom folder structures and labeling strategies
  - üß© Modular design for integrating with downstream AI services
  - üìö Reusable setup for multiple classification use cases

## Getting Started
1. Environment Setup:
  - Install the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli and verify with az --version
  - Log in using az loginmca
  - Create a resource group in Azure Foundry
  - Provision Azure Resources:
    - Create a Document Intelligence resource in the Azure Portal
    - Note the key and endpoint for API access
  - Set up a Storage Account and Blob Container for training data
  - Upload Training Data:
    - Organize documents into folders by class 
    - Use az storage blob upload-batch to upload folders to your container
2. Train a Classifier:
  - Open Document Intelligence Studio
  - Create a new custom classifier project
  - Select the container and folder structure
  - Run training and validate model performance
  - Integrate with Content Understanding:
      - Use the classifier output as input to Azure AI Foundry‚Äôs Content Understanding
      - Define schemas for structured extraction
      - Deploy as part of a scalable document processing pipeline 4
        
## Requirements
- Python 3.x (for optional automation)
- Azure CLI
- Azure subscription with access to:
  - Azure AI Document Intelligence
  - Azure AI Foundry
  - Storage Account and Blob Container
  - Labeled training data (minimum 5 documents per class)
